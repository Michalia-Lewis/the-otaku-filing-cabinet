# Meeting Template

Go through this template in preparation for your meeting with the course staff member. We are not grading you on this template, just will help with questions and discussion. Please note, staff have the right to ask you to schedule a second meeting. The goal is to help you flesh out a reasonable project for this course, so make sure to use these meetings as a resource!

## Project Ideas
What are some ideas for your project? Why does that interest you?
* Taking the updated stars rating program from homework 5 and turning it into a web based app

## What are the big ideas?
* Practice with using user input, functions, coding defensively, loops (possibly both for and while), dictionaries, global/local variables. There are others but I feel these are going to be the bulk of my project.

## Code Design Thoughts
* I'm considering classes and dictionaries for storing and updating information

## Resources Found
* I haven't found any resources yet, but I am working through Flask tutorials via YouTube.

## Timeline
Setup a general timeline that includes research and development, and when you want to have certain aspects of the project done.
